Reflecting on these results, it is noted that there are many missing or NA values that were omitted from the HOLC grade data. These missing values had an average percent low income of about 27.3%. Areas that were graded an A by HOLC had a percent low income of about 15%, which differs significantly with the D graded areas with a percent low income of 39.2%. This places the missing data (making up about 43% of the total 2021 EJScreen LA data) between the highest and lowest grades possible by HOLC. Likewise, these communities are not historically redlined, however may not be necessarily have a strong advantage either. 

There is a cascading effect on increasing socioeconomic constraints and negative health effects as the grade decreases. Because of this historical redlining, disadvantaged communities have less available medical resources and closer proximity to hazardous polluting facilities, contributing to the greater levels of air pollutants and low life expectancy. 

Looking at the values that were recorded by the Home Owner's Loan Corporation Grades in the 1930s, about 20% of the overall measured data was in the D range. Unsurprisingly, census tracts that were given a D grade had the highest averages of percent low income, percentile of particulate matter 2.5, and percentile of low life expectancy. Furthermore, these adverse health effects are linked to the historical redlining of marginalized residents, a form of institutionalized racism whose effect is proven in the 2021 EJScreen data.

```

Looking at the bird data, the bar plot shows that the highest percentage of bird observations is found  in the C graded areas. The second highest percentage of bird observations is found in the D graded areas, which does not match with the findings in Ellis-Soto et al. 2023. The highest number of observations were found in both areas of HOLC grades C and D. Ellis-Soto and co authors found that these redlined areas were the most undersampled, and while this may still be true, the biodiversity data based on bird observations is not true. However, the concerns for undersampled areas influencing conservation decisions remain important to the conversation of adverse impacts as a result of historical redlining. Environmental injustices as such create additional barriers to biodiversity access, and it should be considered that there may bias as to how this biodiversity data was collected in redlined areas. For example, the Biden administration has authorized federal and state governments to focus on historically neglected areas to increase conservation efforts, potentially could have influenced the greater amount of bird observations in 2022 within these redlined areas.
